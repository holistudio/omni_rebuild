# The Idea

A chatbot that has long form conversations with you about books, interests in stories in general. Based on these conversations, the nuanced details of your interest come through and become the basis for its recommendations for what book to read.

Ideally, the chatbot has "read" all the books' full text. If the user has particular preferences for the style of prose and dialogue, those preferences can then be mapped or tied to speciic works that have that kind of writing style and improve the recommendation quality. Overall, the book recommendations are informed by the semantic richness of the conversation with the user integrated with the chatbot's semantically rich understanding of all books in its knowledge base.

From an outward appearance, the chatbot appears on a website as its core interface element - not the tertiary bottom right corner of the screen. The overall look and feel of the website should not evoke any feelings of "high tech AI." It should feel more like a a nice bookstore, library, or coffee shop, reflecting the best settings where bibliophiles may enjoy both reading and talking about the books they read.



## Sidebar

This project has two underlying motivations: 

1. A chance for me to learn the LangChain framework for programming chatbots with retrieval augmented generation (RAG).

2. A quick study into whether vibecoding is enough to re-build the original Project Omni, which relied on a PostGreSQL database of questions and the Google Books API for book recommendations based on a simple search.

I've enjoyed books such as Interior Chinatown, movies Prestige and 2001 Space Odyssey, and TV shows Bear and Futurama. Sci-fi and AI Book Why really helped understand how people learn and can learn statistics. Michael Lewis seeing characters grow course story recently enjoyed film Ne Zha, especially emotional storyline and character growth. Not really Comfort reads friends wonder if there are stories people using technology that's open source and how that means people can do lot good or evil.

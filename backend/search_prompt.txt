stories that seem relate everyday life then get weird and surreal. Shows Twin Peaks. Sci-fi and AI course! Zen and Art Motorcycle Maintenance remains book think every now and then enjoy Haruki Murakami's writing style lot. did not Dickens writing yea all that sounds great I've been liking TV show Bear, it's really warm show family that runs restaurant. characters all grow creativity and as human beings. Not interested non-fiction moment little challenging and little comfortable too friends wonder if there are stories people using technology that's open source and how that means people can do lot good or evil.
